Object Destructuring:

If we want to use a different variable name then we can do it like below.

let {name: fullName, age: completeAge, role: designation} = person;

console.log(fullName, completeAge, designation);
//Pratyush Praveen 26 software engineer

Nested objects destructuring:
We can also use the destructuring for nested objects.

let person = {
     name: 'Pratyush Praveen',
     age: 26,
     address:{
        street: 'random',
        city: 'mumbai',
        pincode: 400607
     }
}

let {address: {street, city}} = person;
console.log(street, city);
// random mumbai

Custom variables with nested objects destructuring.
let {address: {street: completeStreet , city: completeCity}} = person;
console.log(completeStreet, completeCity);
// random mumbai
