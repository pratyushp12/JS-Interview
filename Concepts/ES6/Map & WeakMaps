Just like Sets, Maps are also used to store the unique values except here it is key value pair.


WeakMaps are to the Maps what WeakSets are to the Sets. In weakMap every key must be object, 
inserting an non-object will result in error. Objects are held weakly so that if there is no reference to key then
that key value will be removed from the WeakMap or garbage collected.


Difference between Maps and WeakMaps
WeakSets can use objects as key unlike the Maps.
Passing non-objects as key will result in error.
The has(key) and delete(key) method returns false for non-object.
They have only four methods has(key), delete(key), get(key), set(key, value).
WeakMaps are not Iteratable.
